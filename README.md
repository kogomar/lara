<p>This is simple code for test</p>
<p>What I have added:</p>
<ul>
    <li>I prefer to use Services where based all db queries</li>
    <li>User role permissions can be added via Middleware or Policies (there is I used Policy). For sure we need to use table for roles but I added them like const only for test</li>
    <li>I didn't use validator here but off course we need to use it in real Project</li>
</ul>
